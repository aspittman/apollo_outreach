I came across {company} and thought {domain} could be a strong fit for a lending, funding, or commercial finance brand.

The name is direct, easy to understand, and tied to people already searching for funding options.

I currently own {domain} and would be open to selling it for ${price}.

No pressure either way — just thought it could be useful for a future campaign, landing page, or brand asset.

Thanks,
Aaron"""
